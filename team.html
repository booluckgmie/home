                Once upon a time, Cam was stranded on an island with Justin and a pirate puzzle master named Tomer. Tomer lined up 100 treasure chests in a cave, labeled 100 coconuts from 1 to 100, and placed one coconut in each chest. Tomer then led Justin into the cave and allowed him to look inside the chests and even swap the contents of two of them. (What a nice guy!) Afterwards, he hit Justin over the head with a wooden plank to knock him out. (Not a nice guy!) Tomer then led Cam into the cave, gave him a random number, and said, “You may open 50 chests. If you find your number, I'll help you off the island.” Thankfully, Cam and Justin knew about Tomer's crazy riddle ahead of time, which allowed them to devise a surefire strategy. That is, they knew <em>for sure</em> that Cam would be able to find his number. What was their strategy? (Cam now works for KA as a math question writer, as do Justin and Tomer.)

                Before joining the Data Science team, Amy was at Harvard/MIT analyzing neuroimaging data. Though she still thinks brains are very cool, Amy is psyched to now be using data to understand and improve the learning experience of millions of students around the world. When she is not playing her computer, Amy likes to climb rocks and rock-shaped polyurethane.

                    with his two sons, traveling around the US looking for the best

                <p>
                    David studied particle physics at UC Davis and also had fun doing research on
